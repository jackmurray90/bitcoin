  As of July 2023, it's estimated that the entire value of all the gold ever
  mined is around $12.25 trillion. In contrast, the overall market cap for
  bitcoin is roughly $850 billion.

  Bitcoin has all the desirable properties of gold that make it suitable for
  money, plus some even more desirable properties such as the ability to
  transfer it instantly internationally and total scarcity. I personally
  believe a fair valuation would see Bitcoin valued closer to gold, if not more
  than gold.
