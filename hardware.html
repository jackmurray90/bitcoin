  <div>Why use a hardware wallet?</div> The attack surface of a dedicated device is much
  smaller than your computer. For $1 million anybody can buy some browser
  0-day, link you to a dodgy website, and take control of your device. In these
  circumstances, if you store your Bitcoin on your computer, you will lose
  access to the funds. Hacking a dedicated device for signing transactions is
  much more difficult: It is unlikely that there is any remote Trezor 0-day,
  and if there was people would soon find out about it and fix it.

<div>
  <div>Why Trezor?</div> Everything they do is open-source. You can literally replicate
  the device using the plans they've made public. This means security auditors
  around the world have access to the source and can audit for potential
  vulnerabilities. Many eyes on the code means less bugs.

  <div>I only have 0.1 BTC to secure and it's not worth it for me to buy a Trezor.
    What are my other options?</div>
  You can store your coin using Electrum on your
  Mac, PC, Linux, or Android device. Most likely nobody is going to use $1M
  0-day to hack your device, so it's probably safe. When that 0.1 BTC is worth
  $100k, then you should consider investing in a hardware wallet like the
  Trezor described above.

<div>
  <div>Where should I buy it?</div>
  Not e-bay or amazon from some random seller. Buy it from the original
  creators. I used to know a guy who sold cheap keyboards on e-bay installed
  with keyloggers that sent everything that was typed back to his computer.
  Don't trust random hardware.
